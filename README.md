# Linux Notes
![alt text](https://blog.rickliu.im/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Four_Penguins.jpeg)
Linux kernel do boot but crashes pretty soon.\
All four cores are up after a recent update of bootshim\
You will need a device tree with the kernel.\
Some development of the device specific device tree is needed.\
For a partially working kernel, see https://github.com/rickliu2000/linux_nokia_msm8974

# TO-DO
We no longer need to implement MpPark since the recent update of bootshim by @imbushuo. A ram patch stops core 1-3 from being powered on before the old firmware exits
